# Tutorial: A brief overview of mathematical optimization

## Introduction

This repository was created for a tutorial I taught at the [Winter Workshop on Complex Systems 2022](https://wwcs2022.github.io/) held from 24-28 January in Arc-et-Senans, France.

This is a set of slides and a bit of example code to explain some central ideas of how to apply mathematical programming techniques, in particular (integer) linear programming. It focuses on applications related to networks/graphs and paints the idea of how the algorithms do not perform "merely" brute force. Practical matters of relevant software, in particular (commercial) solvers and relevant Python packages are discussed.

## Materials
